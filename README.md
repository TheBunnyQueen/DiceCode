# DiceCode Programming Language
## Introduction
<p>
  DiceCode is a programming language meant to help DM's and game developers analyse random events in the games they are developing, or simply analyse any system with random events. The language is meant to be very procedural and simple to write and interact with, being heavily inspired by C, just without pointer arithmetic.
</p>
<p>
  The language should be able to run and be used on-console.

## The ISO file

<p>
  The ISO file accompanying this project is currently incomplete, lacking a few features that should be in the final ISO at least for version Alpha 1.0.
